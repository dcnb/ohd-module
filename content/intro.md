Oral History as Data (OHD) is a static web framework that will let you publish a collection of oral history/qualitative interviews online. This project asks you to copy a working repository of interviews and replace them with your own. To do that, you'll follow these steps: 

1. Transform your interview text into a spreadsheet 
2. Code sections of your transcripts by subject
3. Copy the OHD repository and replace its contents with your own
2. Customize and Publish your site on GitHub Pages 

At the end of the process you will have a fully baked website that publishes each of your transcripts and allows for users to search interviews by keyword or browse by topics that you assign. It also features some spiffy visualizations to entice engagement. 

## GitHub Pages 

We will be publishing our collections using a GitHub feature is [GitHub Pages](https://guides.github.com/features/pages/).

GitHub Pages provides free static web hosting from any repository.
Gh-pages is intended to host relatively simple sites for your GitHub portfolio, project, or documentation.
Because it is free and a valuable transferable skill, this is a great option for teaching and learning.

## Publishing Audio and Video of Your Interviews:

OHD is set up to publish and connect transcripts to videos hosted by YouTube or Vimeo, mp3 files hosted on Soundcloud, or mp3s stored locally. 

There are *soft* limits and guidelines for gh-pages usage: sites should be < 1GB, use < 100GB bandwidth per month, and make < 10 builds per hour.
If your site exceeds these quotas, GitHub will send you a notice asking you to modify the repository.

This may effect you if your also trying to publish a collection of Mp3s or Mp4s within this repository, so just be aware!

**Also All content must follow the [community guidelines](https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/), e.g. no violence, obscene sex, or illegal stuff.**

## About Oral History as Data

Oral History as Data was first built in 2018, coming out of work at the University of Idaho Library's [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CD?L)](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/). 
The framework served as the foundation for several digital humanities projects, including [Voices of Gay Rodeo](https://www.voicesofgayrodeo.com/), [Idaho Queered](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/queered/), and [CTRL+Shift](https://ctrl-shift.org/). 

The project is closely related to the [CollectionBuilder](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/) project, and the current iteration was built on top of a CollectionBuilder-GH template.
