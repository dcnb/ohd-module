## Step 2: Clean Your Transcript 


Smart quotes, single character ellipses, and other artifacts won't render correctly on the web so it's best to clean your text before you transform it for the tool. This should also make it so that your transcript transfers nicely into the cells of your spreadsheet.

To clean your transcript use the forms below : 

{% include wordcleaner.html%}


 
- Copy the clean version of your transcript from the bottom form by selecting all the text in the form: 
    - Click into the form. 
    - Push CTRL+A on your keyboard to select all of the text in the from. (You will see the contents become highlighted)
    - Push CTRL+C to copy the text to your clipboard. 
- You will paste your clean transcript into the black transcript starter in the next step.
