Smart quotes, single character ellipses, and other artifacts won't render correctly on the web so it's best to clean your text before you transform it for the tool. To do so: 

- Take the text from your transcript (be that in a Word file, a PDF or some other format) and run it through this [text cleaner provided by Jonathan Hedley](https://jhy.io/tools/convert-word-to-plain-text){:target="_blank"}
    - This should also make it so that your transcript transfers nicely into the cells of your spreadsheet.   
- Copy and paste the text into the top window, press clean, and then copy the text from the bottom window.
