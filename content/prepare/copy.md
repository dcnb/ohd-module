## Step 1: Copy the Spreadsheet Template


- Here is a [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWrPMItiP-XOSkm7gyC8b9bl3tpSQRj9zLzS5y8QnW0/copy){:target="_blank"} to help you get started. 
- Make a copy of the template by clicking on the link above and then clicking the "Make a Copy" button. 
- Give your transcript a simple name, preferrably `lastname_firstname` with no spaces or characters that aren't letters. But it's less important to get the naming right in the Google Sheet now, then it is to correctly name the CSV file you'll download later. 
- If the interviewee has elected not to use his or her whole last name, use the first initial of their last name in place of their last name: `initialfirstname` (example: `broger`)
- If the interviewee has elected not to use his or her last name at all, simply title the transcript with their firstname: `firstname` (example: `roger`)
