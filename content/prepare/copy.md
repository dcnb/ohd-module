## Step 1: Copy the Spreadsheet Template


- Here is a [Blank Transcript Starter Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uWrPMItiP-XOSkm7gyC8b9bl3tpSQRj9zLzS5y8QnW0/copy){:target="_blank"} to help you get started. 
- Make a copy of the template by clicking on the link above and then clicking the "Make a Copy" button. 
- Give your transcript a simple name, preferrably `lastname_firstname` with no spaces or characters that aren't letters. But it's less important to get the naming right in the Google Sheet now, then it is to correctly name the CSV file you'll download later. 
- Return to the instructions. We will use this blank template in step 3.
