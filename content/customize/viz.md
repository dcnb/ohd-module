OHD offers a way to categorize your transcripts using tags. This is done through two locations: the "tag" column cells in your transcript's CSV and the filters.csv file, which is already provided for you in the structure of OHD. If you are not aware of either of these files, first visit our steps on "[How To Prepare Your Data](prepareyourdata.html)." 


{% include youtube/embed.html  video-id="esUuJbhXKW4" title="Creating Filters" display="d-none d-md-block" %}
- Open the filters.csv file you created in your text editor. 
- Navigate to the "_data" folder 
- Open the "_data" folder and click the pencil icon to edit the file
- Copy and paste the filters.csv you created in the Prepare Your Data tutorial over into the existing content. 
- Alternatively, you can simply edit the CSV file here. (Below is how the file looks when opened with the pencil icon.)
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/texteditorfile.png" caption="Filters.csv as it looks in a text editor" alt="opened file, ready for editing" class="w-50" %}
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/githubfile.png" caption="filters.csv copied into GitHub" alt="filters.csv copied into GitHub" class="w-50" %}
- Commit the change at the bottom of the page by clicking the commit button (be sure to write a commit message so you can track your changes)
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/commit_file.png" caption="" alt="picture of the commit button at bottom of page" class="w-50" %}
- However you edited it, the finished CSV should look like the example below (with your new tags and descriptions) in GitHub
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/githubfilefinal.png" caption="CSV after being transferred to GitHub" alt="finished csv after being transferred to github" class="w-50" %}
- Below is a slightly more robust example of what your visualization will look like. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/visualization.png" caption="finished OHD visual" alt="picture of finished visualization" class="w-50" %}
