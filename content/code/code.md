## Add Tags/Codes to Your Transcript Spreadsheet (Optional)

*Note: in order to enable the visualization, you must have coded your spreadsheet*

If you'd like to enable subject-based browsing and color-coded visualizations for your transcript, you need to "code" portions of the conversation according to the subject matter. 

- To do this, start adding "tags"-- which should be shorthand descriptions of larger thematic subjects that pertain to this and other transcripts in a collect-- in the cells under the "tags" column that pertain to the content in the adjacent "words" cell. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/subjects_cell.png" caption="example subjects" alt="picture of the subjects cells" %}
- If you have multiple subjects in a cell, separate them with a semi-colon (as pictured above). 
- You'll often want to cover a large portion of the transcript with the same tags. In Google Sheets, you can do this by hovering over the bottom right of a cell (pictured below) and then dragging your cursor across the pertinent sections of the transcript below or above where you started. 
    - This saves a great deal of time, as usually sections of the oral history are all pertaining to the same tags/subjects. 
{% include bootstrap/figure.md img="howto/bottom-right-corner.png" caption="Click here, hold, and drag the cursor down to pull down the tags across a section " alt="image of example subjects in cells" %}
