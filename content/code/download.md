- Once you've edited the Google Sheet and gotten everything in order, go to the "file" tab at the top of your sheet and hover over "download"
- Select "comma-separated values"  to save your file as a .csv file
- Once downloaded, rename your transcript so that's its as simple as possible, removing any spaces or special characters. 
    - We typically use either just the last name, for small collections, or `lastname_firstname`, for larger collections. Make sure the file retains its (.csv) extension.
